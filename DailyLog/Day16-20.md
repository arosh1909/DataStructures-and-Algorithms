Pheww... what 5 days... I'm better this way.. Back to work... 
- [ ] Writing 2 paper in malwares.
- [ ] Talk to Kapil Sir if possible meet him.
- [ ] get up and sleep and work and be independent. Notice thoughts that bring you down. 


Write down thoughts that take you down or up
Focus on getting independent. You have no other option.
Focus of clearing M.Tech. and securing a job.
No time, literaaly for any stupid shit. 1-1/2 year .
Wake up timely and start working. But you need that natural high!
