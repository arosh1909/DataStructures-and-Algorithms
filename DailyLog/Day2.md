# Day2-25-December-2020
Today, after implementing mergesort and insertion sort yesterday, I moved on to chapter 4 in CLRS. it is divide and conquer algos. first algo is the maximum sub array problem. while implementing I spent a lot of time implementing multiple return values in cpp. It is handled with the use of tie() with make tuple or the new c++17 feature called structured binding which makes for more clean code. took me 3-4 hours of faded focus work to get it to work.
Now I plan to implement other divide and conquer algo today, like strassen's algorithm which beats the straightforward way to multiply matrices.

This day ended with me watching a movie with her and sleeping. I did not work after implementing max sub array problem. I'm sorry.s
