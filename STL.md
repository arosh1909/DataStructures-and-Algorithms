# C++ standard template library;;
* In #include<limits> there is numberic_limits<int>::max() template class function max which gives maximum value of int. Similarly more template classes are available for other data types.
* #include<tuple> has make_tuple and tie to accept and return multiple types, MaximumSumSubarray problem in divide and conquer has its implementation when I had to return multiple values back from a function, namely start and end index of the subarray and the max sum.
* Structured binding is c++17 way to return multiple values.
